# InstagramAPI
10 - Instagram API
Use the instagram API to make something cool, for example:

Users should be able to enter a hashtag and get a list of accounts they can follow that use that hashtag.

The details of how you select these accounts is up to you - there’s different ways with different levels of difficulty:

Easy: Take the first 10 accounts you find that use that hashtag
Medium: Recommend accounts first that have the most posts/followers/…
Hard: Let the user select what’s most important to them (follower #, post count, recently active, …)
Note: An important part of this task will be reading the Instagram API documentation and understanding how to interact with it.
