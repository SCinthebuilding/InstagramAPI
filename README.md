11 - Spotify API
Use the spotify API to do something cool, for example: User should be able to enter an artist and get 10 song recommendations

The details of how you select these songs is up to you - thereâ€™s different ways with different levels of difficulty:

Easy: Take the 10 most streaed songs of that artist
Medium: Let the user pick an album, pick songs from that album first
Hard: Mix in songs from similar artists
